# Datasets For Recommender Systems

This is a repository of public data sources for Recommender Systems (RS).

All of these recommendation datasets can convert to the atomic files
defined in [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole),
which is a unified, comprehensive and efficient recommendation library.

After converting to the atomic files, you can use RecBole
to test the performance of different recommender models on these datasets easily.
For more information about RecBole, please refer to [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole).


## Usage
In order to use RecBole, you need to convert these original datasets to the atomic file
which is a kind of data format defined by RecBole.

We provide two ways to convert these datasets into atomic files:

1. Download the raw dataset and process it with conversion tools we provide in this repository. Please refer to [conversion tools](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecDatasets/tree/master/conversion_tools).

2. Directly download the processed atomic files. [Baidu Wangpan](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1p51sWMgVFbAaHQmL4aD_-g) (Password: e272), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1so0lckI6N6_niVEYaBu-LIcpOdZf99kj?usp=sharing).
